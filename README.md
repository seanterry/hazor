# Hazor
Sample project demonstrating how to use HTMX with Blazor Static SSR (and minimal APIs).

## Overview
This sample will demonstrate how to configure a Blazor Static SSR project to work with HTMX, allowing you to create
dynamic, interactive web applications with server-side rendering.

The result is a lot less like "Blazor" and a lot more "Razor components with client interactivity provided (mostly) by
HTMX".
